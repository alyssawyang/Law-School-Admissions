Final project for Stats 451: Bayesian Data Analysis
Group members: Alyssa Yang, Joon Choi, Chris Cheng

This study endeavors to construct a predictive model for assessing admission outcomes at the University of Michigan Law School by analyzing a combination of demographic variables and academic indicators. Specifically, Bayesian analysis techniques will be used to incorporate factors such as LSAT scores, undergraduate GPAs, international student status, and underrepresented minority (URM) status. Drawing upon historical data from the University of Michigan Law School applicants, our objective is to develop a robust model capable of accurately projecting the admission status of future applicants.

This research seeks to deepen the understanding of the determinants influencing admission decisions, while offering practical insights for both prospective applicants and admissions committees. Through the application of statistical methodologies to institutional data, this study contributes to the broader conversation surrounding admissions practices within higher education institutions.
